#My Improv that I did on 13th October 2011

#Cristian is standing on the right of the space
#he slides into the space
#he feels the weight on hands and feet
#he rewinds
#he transfers weight in a challenging way
#he balances uncertainly
#He falls slowly and lands on the floor sitting
#He waits and rewinds
#He enters the space three points at a time
#He slides to the back 
#He makes L shape and rests
#He watches the time
#He lies back on the floor
#He rolls in the air somehow
#and he needs to rest again
#he is lying down
#he flops his limbs
#He spins on the floor with head as centre point
#he stands carefully facing the opposite side
